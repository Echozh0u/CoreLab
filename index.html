     <h2 style="text-align: left;">Surface<br></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Usually the mainstream media we contact is Surface web, such as YouTube, X, Ig and so on.<br>
At the same time, the Surface information we come into contact with on the Internet is mostly about Internet celebrities, stars and news. Take Tiktok as an example, when we first registered, the content we brushed was some of the world's famous stars or Internet celebrities. After we have used it for a period of time, it will push us influencers or popular videos in the field we are interested in.<br>
In the concept of "surface", the information and platforms we are exposed to are mostly mainstream, and we do not need to search for it personally, or we get this information is "trend".<br>

<h2>
    Deep & Dark
</h2>
<p>
    Beneath the surface, the Internet also has a lot of websites or information that needs to be encrypted to be accessed; At the same time, there are a large number of dark nets, which have special channels to enter, but occupy a large proportion of the Internet.
<br>
The Internet is like a huge iceberg, and what we have touched is only the tip of the ice iceberg surface. Those under the sea and deep in the sea also exist in this Internet iceberg.
